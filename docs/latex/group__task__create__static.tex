Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.

Internally, within the Free\+RTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of memory. The first block is used to hold the task\textquotesingle{}s data structures. The second block is used by the task as its stack. If a task is created using task\+\_\+create() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically allocated inside the task\+\_\+create() function. (see \href{http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+freertos.\+org/a00111.\+html}}). If a task is created using task\+\_\+create\+\_\+static() then the application writer must provide the required memory. task\+\_\+create\+\_\+static() therefore allows a task to be created without using any dynamic memory allocation.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em pv\+Task\+Code} & Pointer to the task entry function. Tasks must be implemented to never return (i.\+e. continuous loop).\\
\hline
{\em pc\+Name} & A descriptive name for the task. This is mainly used to facilitate debugging. The maximum length of the string is defined by config\+MAX\+\_\+\+TASK\+\_\+\+NAME\+\_\+\+LEN in \doxylink{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source}{Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h}.\\
\hline
{\em ul\+Stack\+Depth} & The size of the task stack specified as the number of variables the stack can hold -\/ not the number of bytes. For example, if the stack is 32-\/bits wide and ul\+Stack\+Depth is defined as 100 then 400 bytes will be allocated for stack storage.\\
\hline
{\em pv\+Parameters} & Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task being created.\\
\hline
{\em ux\+Priority} & The priority at which the task will run.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Stack\+Buffer} & Must point to a task\+\_\+stack\+\_\+t array that has at least ul\+Stack\+Depth indexes -\/ the array will then be used as the task\textquotesingle{}s stack, removing the need for the stack to be allocated dynamically.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Task\+Buffer} & Must point to a variable of type static\+\_\+task\+\_\+s\+\_\+t, which will then be used to hold the task\textquotesingle{}s data structures, removing the need for the memory to be allocated dynamically.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If neither px\+Stack\+Buffer or px\+Task\+Buffer are NULL, then the task will be created and pd\+PASS is returned. If either px\+Stack\+Buffer or px\+Task\+Buffer are NULL then the task will not be created and err\+COULD\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+ALLOCATE\+\_\+\+REQUIRED\+\_\+\+MEMORY is returned.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}

   // Dimensions the buffer that the task being created will use as its stack.
   // NOTE:  This is the number of words the stack will hold, not the number of
   // bytes.  For example, if each stack item is 32-\/bits, and this is set to 100,
   // then 400 bytes (100 * 32-\/bits) will be allocated.
   \#define STACK\_SIZE 200

   // Structure that will hold the TCB of the task being created.
   static\_task\_s\_t xTaskBuffer;

   // Buffer that the task being created will use as its stack.  Note this is
   // an array of task\_stack\_t variables.  The size of task\_stack\_t is dependent on
   // the RTOS port.

       // puxStackBuffer and pxTaskBuffer were not NULL, so the task will have
       // been created, and xHandle will be the task's handle.  Use the handle
       // to suspend the task.
