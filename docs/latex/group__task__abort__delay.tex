INCLUDE\+\_\+x\+Task\+Abort\+Delay must be defined as 1 in \doxylink{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source}{Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h} for this function to be available.

A task will enter the Blocked state when it is waiting for an event. The event it is waiting for can be a temporal event (waiting for a time), such as when task\+\_\+delay() is called, or an event on an object, such as when \doxylink{group__apix_gaca6420b7d656b9559a7d366eb58b8e57}{queue\+\_\+recv()} or task\+\_\+notify\+\_\+take() is called. If the handle of a task that is in the Blocked state is used in a call to task\+\_\+abort\+\_\+delay() then the task will leave the Blocked state, and return from whichever function call placed the task into the Blocked state.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Task} & The handle of the task to remove from the Blocked state.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the task referenced by x\+Task was not in the Blocked state then pd\+FAIL is returned. Otherwise pd\+PASS is returned. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
