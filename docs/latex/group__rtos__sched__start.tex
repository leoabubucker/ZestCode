\begin{DoxyPre}void rtos\_sched\_start( void );\end{DoxyPre}


Starts the real time kernel tick processing. After calling the kernel has control over which tasks are executed and when.

See the demo application file main.\+c for an example of creating tasks and starting the kernel.

Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
void vAFunction( void )
\{
    // Create at least one task before starting the kernel.
    task\_create( vTaskCode, "{}NAME"{}, STACK\_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE\_PRIORITY, NULL );

    // Start the real time kernel with preemption.
    rtos\_sched\_start ();

    // Will not get here unless a task calls rtos\_sched\_stop ()
\}
  \end{DoxyPre}
