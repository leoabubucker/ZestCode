\begin{DoxyPre}
void vStreamBufferDelete( stream\_buf\_t xStreamBuffer );
\end{DoxyPre}


Deletes a stream buffer that was previously created using a call to stream\+\_\+buf\+\_\+create() or stream\+\_\+buf\+\_\+create\+\_\+static(). If the stream buffer was created using dynamic memory (that is, by stream\+\_\+buf\+\_\+create()), then the allocated memory is freed.

A stream buffer handle must not be used after the stream buffer has been deleted.
