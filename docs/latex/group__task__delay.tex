\begin{DoxyPre}void task\_delay( const uint32\_t xTicksToDelay );\end{DoxyPre}


Delay a task for a given number of ticks. The actual time that the task remains blocked depends on the tick rate. The constant port\+TICK\+\_\+\+PERIOD\+\_\+\+MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick rate -\/ with the resolution of one tick period.

INCLUDE\+\_\+v\+Task\+Delay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available. See the configuration section for more information.

task\+\_\+delay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to the time at which task\+\_\+delay() is called. For example, specifying a block period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after task\+\_\+delay() is called. task\+\_\+delay() does not therefore provide a good method of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency at which task\+\_\+delay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task next executes. See task\+\_\+delay\+\_\+until() for an alternative API function designed to facilitate fixed frequency execution. It does this by specifying an absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should unblock.

Example usage\+:

void v\+Task\+Function( void \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} pv\+Parameters ) \{ Block for 500ms. const uint32\+\_\+t x\+Delay = 500 / port\+TICK\+\_\+\+PERIOD\+\_\+\+MS; \begin{DoxyVerb}for( ;; )
{
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Simply toggle the LED every 500ms, blocking between each toggle. v\+Toggle\+LED(); task\+\_\+delay( x\+Delay ); \} \}
