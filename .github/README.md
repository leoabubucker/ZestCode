### FAQ

> Is ZestCode legal?

Yup, 100% legal. It is not prohibited in the V5RC, VURC, or VAIRC game manual, and it's legal from a copyright standpoint.

> Why can ZestCode be compiled from source, but PROS can't?

PROS depends on `libv5rts`, which is a private version of the VEX SDK. ZestCode depends on `libv5rt.a`, which is public.
